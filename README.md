## Author

## Class Link
(put your course homepage / Canvas link here)

## Project Objective
Build a front-end only personal homepage using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ modules (no frameworks, no jQuery).  
The site includes multiple pages (Home, About, Projects, AI Page), responsive layout, and a small interactive JS feature.

## Pages
- Home: `index.html`
- About: `about.html`
- Projects: `projects.html`
- AI Page: `ai.html`

## Screenshot
Add a screenshot after deployment:

## How to run locally
Option 1 (recommended): use VS Code Live Server
1. Install the “Live Server” extension in VS Code
2. Right-click `index.html` → “Open with Live Server”

Option 2: open the file directly
- Double click `index.html` (some module features may require a local server)

## Deployment
This site is deployed with GitHub Pages:

## GenAI Usage
I used Generative AI tools to support the planning and implementation of this project.

**Tool / Model**
- ChatGPT — GPT-5.2 Thinking

**How it was used**
- Planned the folder structure (css / js / assets) and fixed relative file paths
- Generated starter HTML/CSS layouts aligned with the rubric (semantic tags, responsive layout)
- Helped write concise project descriptions and correct image `alt` text
- Debugged issues such as duplicate HTML blocks, image sizing, and anchor links

**Example prompts**
1. “Create a vanilla HTML/CSS homepage with a hero section, project cards, and an ES6 module script. Keep it W3C-compliant.”
2. “Show me how to add images with correct relative paths and alt text.”
3. “Generate a Projects page and connect cards using anchor links like #canvas.”

**Human decisions / edits**
- Chose the pastel pink theme and final layout
- Selected the projects and edited the final wording
- Added my own screenshots/headshot images
- Verified and tested all links and page behavior
